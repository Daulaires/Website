      <p>
        A VPN, or virtual private network, is a secure tunnel between two or more devices. VPNs are used to protect private web traffic from snooping, interference, and censorship. 
        I am no expert in VPNs, so I will not be explaining how they work as an expert would.

      <p>
        This discord self-bot is a bot that runs on your account. It is against Discord's Terms of Service to use self-bots, so I do not recommend using this.
        But the proof of concept of making a bot live track the ISS on discord was a fun project as well as a learning experience. Handled the database with Enmap, and Json.
        The language I had used to create this was Javascript.
        This projects total lines of code is 2,677 lines.

        <p>
          This pulled the images from the Spacedashboard website and created a video with the provided.
          I am not sure on the exact time but every 15 minutes or so the images of the sun corona and the south, and north pole aurora images are updated.
          The script takes those images and in real time stitches the videos. 
          Anyways, proof of concept was to see if I could make a video creator that would stitch images together in real time before the website updated the images.

          The css and colors were changed to match the theme of the youtubers liking.
